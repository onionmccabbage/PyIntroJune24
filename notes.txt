Know your IDE
    > Navigating Projects
    > Editing Files
    > Setting the interpreter for different python versions
    - Debugging
    - Shortcuts

Python code essentials
    - Learn effective debugging techniques for identifying and resolving errors
    > Foundational Concepts: Datatypes, Variables, and Branching Constructs
    > functions, arguments
    > structure
    > conditionals, loops
    > range object
    > after lunch: review exercise

q - how can we show numbers to a certain acuracy

> while, break, quit
> def (function)

Python datatypes and variables
    > Master the application of branching constructs for decision-making in code
    > Main Collection Types: List, Tuple, Set, Dict

Python's primary collection types
    > Add, remove elements, and iterate over lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
    > Other python Collections

Object-Oriented Programming
    > Learn the principles and syntax of Object-Oriented Programming.
    > Understand how to define and use classes and objects in Python.

Creating Functions, Modules, and Packages
    > functions and classes are written inside modules (files) which are placed in packages (folders)
    > Explore the creation and utilization of functions for modular code.
    > Understand the concept of modules and packages for organizing and structuring code.

Introduction to Functional Programming
    > Familiarize yourself with functional programming concepts in Python.
    - Learn how to use lambdas, higher-order functions, and map/reduce/filter for concise and expressive code.
    - Another review exercise

Packages
    > just a folder to gather related modules
    > might contain __init__.py which is no longer needed


> __main__

> read write files inc write to csv

Future - Jupyter, database, API loading over http, threading, microservices
architecture and best practice, design patterns. Also testing

Skillnet NI forms
- make sure these are completed
