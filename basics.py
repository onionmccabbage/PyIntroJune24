# Python comments look like this
# All python code is written in a module like this
# Variables, data types and collections

a = 3   # this is an integer data type
b = 7.4 # this is a floating point data type

print(a, type(a) ) # NB Python is case-sensitive so keep an eye out...
print(b, type(b) ) 

print( a/b , a*b, a+b, b-a )
